# Hepsi-Surada-Console-App
Object Oriented Programming Project C++

In our project we wanted to design a platform in which you could sign in as a manager or a customer. Both manager and customer accounts have their own futures and menus. If you want to sign in as a customer, the program gives you the choice of signing in or up. We hold customer information in a text file to check sign in values.
The customer menu gives you the chance to see all available products, search them by values or add those products to your basket and complete your shopping. The program decides on a random date each time you start it. Manager holds the power to change the current date which will be affecting the program. There are special dates on specific intervals in which there are discounts available on all products (Halloween, New Year, etc.). Program notifies the user if there are discounts available. If there are not enough stock of the wanted amount, program gives you the option to buy the current amount, and sends a message to the manager.
When the shopping is completed program prepares a fee.txt which includes the information of the payment and shows the discount, product and total amount.
The manager menu gives the manager options to see current products and gives him/her the power to re-arrange and re-stock. You can also add new items and change the date. Items are also saved on a text file just like customers. We made our manager account with secret constructor where program automatically create one manager class with same information with default constructor.
If we had more time we would like to add more options to our Customer menu and try to add funnier encounters.
